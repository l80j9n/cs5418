1.    What does the area enclosed   by the   cycle   represent   on   a   P-v   diagram?   How   about on a T-s   diagram?
2.      Someone   has suggested that the air-standard Otto cycle is   more   accurate   if the         two isentropic processes are replaced with   polytropic   processes with   a   polytropic   exponent n=1.3. Consider such a cycle when the   compression   ratio   is 8,   P1   =   95   kPa, T1 =   15°C, and the   maximum cycle temperature   is   1200°C. Determine   the         heat transferred to and rejected from this cycle, as well as the   cycle thermal   efficiency. Use constant specific heats   at   room   temperature.
3.    A six-cylinder, four-stroke, spark-ignition engine operating on the   ideal   Otto   cycle   takes in air at   14   psia and 65°F, and   is   limited to   a   maximum   cycle   temperature   of 1600°F.   Each cylinder has a bore   of 3.5   in,   and   each   piston   has   a   stroke   of 3.9   in. The minimum enclosed volume is   14% of the maximum   enclosed   volume.   How   much   power will this engine   produce when operated at 2500 rpm?   Use   constant specific heats at room   temperature.
4.    When we double the compression   ratio of an   ideal   Otto   cycle, what   happens to the maximum gas temperature and pressure when the   state   of the air   at the   beginning代 写MAE 115 APPLIED ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS Hw#2
代做程序编程语言 of the compression and the amount of heat addition   remain the same?   Use constant specific heats at   room temperature.
5.    A four-cylinder two-stroke 2.0   L diesel engine that operates   on   an   ideal   Diesel   cycle   has a compression   ratio of 22 and a cutoff   ratio   of   1.8. Air   is   at   70°C   and   97   kPa at the beginning of the compression process.   Using the   cold-air standard assumption, determine how much power the engine   will   deliver   at   2300   rpm.
6.    A six-cylinder, four-stroke, 3.2   K compression-ignition engine operates   on   the   ideal   Diesel cycle with a compression   ratio of 19. The   air   is   at   95   kPa   and   67°C      at the beginning of the compression process and the   engine   speed   is   1750   rpm.   The engine uses light diesel fuel with a   heating value   of 42,500   kJ/kg,   and   air-fuel ratio of 28, and a combustion efficiency of 98%.   Using   constant   specific heats at 850   K, determine (a) the maximum temperature   in   the   cycle   and   the   cutoff   ratio   (b) the   network   output   per   cycle   and   the   thermal   efficiency,   (c)   the mean effective   pressure, (d) the net power output,   and   (e) the   specific   fuel   consumption, in g/kWh defined as the ratio   of the   mass of the fuel   consumed to   the network   produced.
